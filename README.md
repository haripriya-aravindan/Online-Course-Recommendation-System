### Online-Course-Recommendation-System

This project is to build an online course recommendation system that suggests relevant courses to learners based on their interests, past enrollments, and engagement levels. The dataset includes course ratings, instructor information, previous learning history, study material availability, and certification offerings, making it suitable for recommendation models using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.
